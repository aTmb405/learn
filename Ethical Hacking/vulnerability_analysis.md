# Vulnerability Analysis

We're going to start with nmap scripts, which have a lot of functionality.

## Nmap Scripts

`cd /usr/share/nmap/scripts/` - check all of the available scripts

[Nmap Scripts Usage](https://www.nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html)

`nmap --script auth IPADDRESS` - uses non brute force methods to bypass authentication credentials

`nmap --script malware IPADDRESS` - checks for any installed malware or backdoors

`nmap --script banner IPADDRESS` - banners are returned in the response when connecting to a port. They give us the version of the software running on an open port.

`nmap --script exploit IPADDRESS` - aims to actively exploit known vulnerabilities

### Googling Exploits

When we find open ports with versions of running software, simply google 'SOFTWARE VERSION exploit' to search for exploits.

We can also use searchsploit

`searchsploit SOFTWARE` - searches Kali Linux's db for known exploits. Will pull up the type of exploit, the type of OS this occurs on, and the name of the file.

`locate FILENAME` - find complete path to a file

`nano FILENAME` - open file in vim editor

## Nessus

Nessus allows you to scan extremely fast inside of networks. It also provides in-depth assessment and free guidance on using the tool. The paid version allows scanning of 16 IP addresses.

After downloading and getting an activation code, click "New Scan" to begin a new scan.

1. Basic Network Scan
2. Basic -> General -> Target -> list IP addresses of your targets
3. Discovery (determine the type of ports and how many you want to scan) -> All ports
4. Assessment (determine which type of vulnerabilities to scan for - simple vs. complext)
5. Report (leave on default for now)
6. Advanced (leave on default for now)
7. Click "save"

This will output different results ranging from Info - Critical. Clicking on a result will show the exploit and a possible solution to resolve.
