# Vulnerability Analysis

We're going to start with nmap scripts, which have a lot of functionality.

## Nmap Scripts

`cd /usr/share/nmap/scripts/` - check all of the available scripts

[Nmap Scripts Usage](https://www.nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html)

`nmap --script auth IPADDRESS` - uses non brute force methods to bypass authentication credentials

`nmap --script malware IPADDRESS` - checks for any installed malware or backdoors

`nmap --script banner IPADDRESS` - banners are returned in the response when connecting to a port. They give us the version of the software running on an open port.

`nmap --script exploit IPADDRESS` - aims to actively exploit known vulnerabilities

### Googling Exploits

When we find open ports with versions of running software, simply google 'SOFTWARE VERSION exploit' to search for exploits.

We can also use searchsploit

`searchsploit SOFTWARE` - searches Kali Linux's db for known exploits. Will pull up the type of exploit, the type of OS this occurs on, and the name of the file.

`locate FILENAME` - find complete path to a file

`nano FILENAME` - open file in vim editor
