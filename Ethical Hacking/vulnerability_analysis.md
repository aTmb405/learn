# Vulnerability Analysis

We're going to start with nmap scripts, which have a lot of functionality.

`cd /usr/share/nmap/scripts/` - check all of the available scripts

[Nmap Scripts Usage](https://www.nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html)

`nmap --script auth IPADDRESS` - uses non brute force methods to bypass authentication credentials

`nmap --script malware IPADDRESS` - checks for any installed malware or backdoors

`nmap --script banner IPADDRESS` - banners are returned in the response when connecting to a port. They give us the version of the software running on an open port.

`nmap --script exploit IPADDRESS` - aims to actively exploit known vulnerabilities
