# Exploitation

We exploit one of the vulnerabilities we discovered to send a payload to the target. This will allow us to execute commands on the target system's shell and navigate files. 

The payload tells the target system to make a connection to the hacker's computer and allow it to execute commands.

Social engineering is used whenever there are no known vulnerabilities on a target. We would try to get the target to open our payload themselves through a spoofed email or USB drive.
