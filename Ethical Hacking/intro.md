# Intro to Ethical Hacking

## What is Ethical Hacking?

Finding vulnerabilities in systems (networks, servers, computers, websites, etc.) and securing them for businesses.

We will use home devices and virtual machines to practice.

## What is a Virtual Machine?

Machine within our computer that uses it's hardware. This creates a safe area to test and learn ethical hacking. The virtual machine can always be deleted. We just need a virtualization software to allow our computer to run multiple OS.

## Why Linux?

Linux is best for ethical hacking since it is open source, free, good for developing, and light. We can inspect and manipulate it's code and there's a lot of documentation. We can also edit the code to become more optimized for our use case.

We will be using [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) - a distro made specially for penetration testing and ethical hacking - and [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) as our virtualization software.
