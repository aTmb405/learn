# Code Analysis

## Setting up your Environment

1. Fork/clone the repo
2. npm install local packages and open package.json to view dependencies
3. Begin running the programs
4. Check database connector, db tables, etc.
5. Check 3rd party APIs

## Analyzing Code

1. Look through API - endpoints tell you a lot about an app
2. Look through folder structure, read the README, etc.
3. Look through packages imported in the files you're viewing
4. Look through function call stack based on higher level files
5. Look through frontend and repeat 2 - 4
    * For React apps, look through state structure and component structure
    * Focus on different aspects of UX and find the corresponding code
6. Don't immediately criticize the code, you were not there when it was written
