# Testing

Testing helps code contain fewer bugs, find more bugs in your code, and to know when breaking changes are introduced into your code.

Tests can be run in different environments - in the console, DOM, headless browser like Puppateer, or jsdom.

## 3 Main Categories

1. Unit tests - tests individual functions and classes. Cheapest and easiest to implement.
2. Integration tests - how different units of code interacts together.
3. Automation tests - also known as UI tests. Very expensive to implement.

## Testing Libraries

1. 'Scaffolding' to build tests off of -    Jasmine, Jest, Mocha
2. Insertion library -                      Jasmine, Jest, Chai
3. Test Runner -                            Jasmine, Jest, Mocha, Karma
4. Mocks, Spies, and Stubs -                Jasmine, Jest, Sinon
5. Code Coverage -                                   Jest, Istanbul
