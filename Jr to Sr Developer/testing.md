# Testing

Testing helps code contain fewer bugs, find more bugs in your code, and to know when breaking changes are introduced into your code.

3 Main Categories

1. Unit tests - tests individual functions and classes. Cheapest and easiest to implement.
2. Integration tests - how different units of code interacts together.
3. Automation tests - also known as UI tests. Very expensive to implement.
